# Mock-up of GlassNode

This project was developed with [React.js](https://zh-hans.react.dev/), [EChart.js](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html), and [Bootstrap.js](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

This project is developed individually by *easy@datalouder.com*.

## Project Description

This project is a mock-up of a on-chain crypto exchange platform GlassNode. It is a single page application that allows users to view the historical data of BTC and ETH. This application has a compare feature that allows users to compare through all available data they are interested in.

## Requirements

[Node.js 16.16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0) is required to run this project.

### Installation of this required version of Node.js

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage Node.js versions.

The installation across different operating systems is described in the [nvm README](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md). Please follow the instructions to install nvm. You can check if nvm is installed by running the following command:

```bash
nvm --version
```

After installing nvm, run the following command to install Node.js version 16.16:

```bash
nvm install 16.16
```

## Run Scripts

After installing Node.js 16.16, you will need to run the following scripts sequentially.
to deploy this project, 

### `npm install`

This script will install all the dependencies required to run this project. It is required to run this script before running any other scripts.

### `npm run build`

This script will build the project for production. It is required to run this script before running the server.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits on the source code.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console. Feel free to ignore these errors, or fix them and submit a pull request:)

## Other Scripts

There are other scripts that are not required to run this project. But they are useful for development and testing.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
